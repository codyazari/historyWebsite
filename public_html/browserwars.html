    <h1>The Browser Wars</h1>
    <h3 class="lead">Before The Browser Wars</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The World Wide Web was an incredible invention created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. However, the web was extremely hard to navigate if you were not a tech geek.</li>
        <li>This changed when a Illinois undergrad student, Marc Andreessen, came up with the idea that everyone should be able to use the internet. The result of this idea was the world's first graphical web Browser, Mosaic.</li>
        <li>In 1993, Mosaic was posted online as a free gift to humanity.</li>
        <li>The web browsers used today are descendants of Mosaic.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="lead"> Who was involved?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> The Browser war was a battle between NetScape and Microsoft for the market dominance of Internet Web Browsers.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="lead">NetScape</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>NetScape was created by Marc Andreessen, Jim Clark, Aleks Totic, and Rob McCool. </li>
        <li>After leaving Silicon Graphics, Jim Clark was looking for the next best thing to invest in. That next best thing was Mosaic. When Clark was introduced to Mosaic, he reached out to Marc Andreessen about creating a software company.  </li>
        <li>In 1994, NetScape's Navigator web browser hit the streets and became an instant success.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="lead">Microsoft</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>In 1975, Bill Gates Dropped out of Harvard to build microsoft with Paul Allen</li>
        <li>Gates' goal was for all PCs to use Microsoft Software.</li>
        <li>This goal almost became a reality with 90% of PCs running Microsoft Software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="lead">NetScape vs. Microsoft</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The NetScape web browser was an instant success and kick-started the internet age. </li>
        <li>In 1995, Microsoft held a meeting with NetScape to express their interest in investing in NetScape. NetScape was not interested in working with Microsoft. In Fact, they wanted to take them out.</li>
        <li>Microsoft ended up offering NetScape 1 Million in exchange for access to all of NetScape's Technology or else. This sparked the beginning of a lawsuit. NetScape hired anti-trust lawyer, Gary Reback, shortly after the meeting. </li>
        <li>NetScape decided to go public on August 9th, 1995. The stocks went through the roof. This led NetScape to believe that they were invincible. Marc Andreessen was quoted saying "Microsoft is a poorly debugged set of device drivers." This was a horrible idea.</li>
        <li>After hearing what Andreessen said, Microsoft made it their priority to run NetScape to the ground. Their plan was to imitate NetScapes every move and chip away at the market share. </li>
        <li>Microsoft then came up with the idea to offer their Internet Explorer to the public for free. NetScape could not afford to do the same. This allowed Microsoft to completely dominate the market share and ultimately end the war. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="lead">War Was Over</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bill Gates threw a party in San Francisco, which is NetScape's stomping grounds.</li>
            <li>Gates also had an Internet Explorer E delivered on NetScape's Front Lawn.</li>
            <li>NetScape was sold to AOL.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="lead">Microsoft not out of the woods</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft was hit with a United States Government Anit-Trust Lawsuit. The US Government accused Microsoft of using its Windows monopoly to engage in a wide variety of predatory business practices to prevent consumers from accessing NetScape. Gates was caught on tape being untruthful about his knowledge of the meeting with NetScape.</li>
        <li>Gates was found guilty. He then gave his Microsoft CEO position to Steve Ballmer and focused on his charity foundation.</li>
    </ul>
