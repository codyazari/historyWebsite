    <h1>3 Tips and Tricks for Implementing Pylint (For a Beginner)</h1>
    <p>
        When starting to program, technical considerations are hardly ever a main point of concern, and why would they
        be? At the very start of learning how to code, you are mainly trying to make sure your program just runs in the
        intended way, much less stress testing it with thousands of data points. Once past the point of beginner,
        the testing of your program becomes a major consideration, and one way to do that is by implementing Pylint.
        From the Pylint documentation itself, "Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce
        a coding standard and looks for code smells. It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend
        suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's
        complexity." Below, I will try to highlight 5 tips for a beginner starting to use Pylint.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Learn how to read the error messages!</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At no offense to you, coding is a difficult task, where many mistakes are bound to happen. You will
                    certainly make many mistakes in your first program. These mistakes don't stop when you're experienced
                    either! Therefore, learning the error messages will allow you to pinpoint and fix problems when
                    detected
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>You can disable errors</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Say you write a program and Pylint constantly returns an irrelevant error message (which is not
                    uncommon). You can signal to Pylint within your code with a # disable=whatever-error-message and it
                    will not flag it as an error
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pylint is not the end-all-be-all of your code</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Seriously. Pylint is just a 2nd opinion. The information it gives is general, and was designed to
                    be as all-encompassing for all kinds of code. Therefore, some errors it gives may not be indicative
                    of your own code. In some contexts, the errors may be devastating, whereas in others, it may not
                    prove to be a problem. Make sure  you double-check before coming to these conclusions and continue \
                    on your merry way.
                </li>
            </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>OOP Glossary</h2>
    <p>
        Below will be a detailed list of Object-Oriented Programming terminology with their corresponding definitions,
        for your use.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Encapsulation:</b> a core principle of OOP. The natural division of labor within your program,
            allocating different tasks to different parts of your program
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Abstraction:</b> a core principle of OOP. Users can only indirectly change the state of a method or class
            to improve security. A classes internal data and functions are hidden from the user
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Inheritance:</b> a core principle of OOP. You can have a 'parent' class and 'children' classes, where
            the children inherit all or some attributes of the parents while also using their own methods
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Polymorphism:</b> a core principle of OOP. The interpreter of the language will be able to tell the difference
            between many similar named classes and methods and return the proper data
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Class:</b> a template of data that can be replicated many times.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Object:</b> the result of the replicated class. When a class is called from code and instantiated with a
            variable, it becomes an object of the class
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Method:</b> a function that belongs to a class. When that function is called, it is considered a method
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Factory:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Instantiation:</b> the creation of an object. When an object is created from a class, the object is
            instantiated
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Namespace:</b> when a class is instantiated with an equivalence to a certain variable, the pair and
            subsequent pairs with the program can be considered a namespace
        </li>
        <li
        ><b>Constructor:</b> this is a method within Python that initializes and assign values in a class when it is
            created.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fixture:</b> primarily used for testing. This is a piece of code that will run everytime a test is executed
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Type Hint:</b> quite literally it's name, you tell give Python a hint as to which type of object
            should be utilized when a program is run. Helps increase predictability with extremely large and complex
            programs
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Type Cast:</b> having the ability to specify the type of data Python should read information as, similar
            to type hinting with classes. Also having the ability to convert data types
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Unit Test:</b> testing individual aspects of a programming
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Static:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Facade:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Property:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Tuple:</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Decorator Method:</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
