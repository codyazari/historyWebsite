  <h1>The Four Principles of Object-Oriented Programming - Calculator Edition!</h1>

  <h3 class="lead">An Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    If you've tried your hand at coding, it's very likely that you've seen or heard the term "Object-Oriented
    Programming" thrown around. Not only that, but you've probably heard some very vague explanations with some
    confusing analogies following it, leaving you only more confused in your desk chair. Don't fret! I and most other
    programmers were just as confused as you when we started, and it still confuses me today! My goal here today is to
    demonstrate the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (I'll call it OOP from now on) so that you can begin
    to piece it together!
  </p>

  <h3 class="lead">What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h3>
  <p>
    To clear up any misconceptions from the jump, OOP is NOT a well-defined set of code that can be copied and pasted
    from program to program. OOP, rather, is a framework of 4 concepts that should be applied to your own projects when
    applicable. These 4 concepts are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    <li>Abstraction</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Alongside these 4 principles, OOP makes liberal use of <b>classes</b> and <b>objects</b>, two important parts of any
    programming language. Before getting into the nitty gritty of OOP, it is quite important to understand what classes
    and objects are and their job in a program. I'll start with classes, then flow into objects. Classes in any
    programming language can be thought of as a template which contains information that can be replicated any number
    of times. This in itself is a powerful tool, because it allows a programmer to only write one block of code and
    continuously use it and the information inside it. The usage of the class creates an object, or an <i>instance</i>
    of the class. To illustrate, below is the code for a Calculator class. In it, it contains the information to add
    numbers and, when called, will produce an instance of the calculator class.

  <h3 class="lead">Encapsulation</h3>
  <p>
    This leads into one of the core principles of OOP, encapsulation. Encapsulation is the natural division of labor
    within the program you are writing. Or in other words, think of a large corporation, with many divisions. Some work
    on the financial aspects of the company, others work on product development, customer service and so on. When these
    divisions need to work with each other or need data from one another, they will put in a request for the specific
    data, then it will be given. This is encapsulation, where a program will have multiple classes, each responsible for
    their own data. When data or information is needed, it will call data from another class using a method. This has
    the added benefit of being more secure, because a classes data or "state" cannot be access and changed, intentionally
    or unintentionally. This can be seen above in a program for a calculator. Instead of having one function wholly in-
    charge of all mathematical functions, we can split each function up with regard to its mathematical operation.
  </p>

  <h3 class="lead">Inheritance</h3>
  <p>
    Now back to this company and it's divisions. The financial division in the company is in charge of all financial
    doings in the company. However, financials in a large company is quite a complex operation, likely with many
    sub-divisions in the parent. These sub-divisions in the financial division are still similar and do similar things
    to the parent division, only with minor tweaks in procedures, operations, and labors. This is inheritance. You can
    write a parent class, each with children that inherit characteristics from the parent, but also have their own
    attributes and functions. To go back to the calculator, we can build a general class that handles calculations,
    and subsequently make mathematical operations (children classes) that inherit the same data types from its
    calculation class (it's parent).
  </p>

  <h3 class="lead">Polymorphism</h3>
  <p>
    Now we find ourselves at polymorphism. Polymorphism, from its Greek roots, means <i>many shapes</i>. Now, you may
    ask, how does this relate to programming?
  </p>
  <!-- LAST PARAGRAPH
  <p>
    Now you may ask, why adhere to these 4 principles? Why can't I just write code however I please, instead of writing
    my program to fit into these weird constraints and parameters? The answer lies in the benefits it provides. Some
    benefits are written below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
