    <h1>The Seperation of Concerns</h1>
    <p>
        Object-oriented programming is a methodology for writing an organized, cohesive program. The core principles of
        OOP all imply a minimum level of organization in which to write a program. To exaggerate the point, you wouldn't
        keep your apples and your toolset in the same cabinet would you? You would keep the apples in the kitchen with
        the other fruits while your toolset would go in the garage with your other tools. Likewise, you wouldn't build
        a workshop in the kitchen and cook in the garage. In programming, this organization of like goes with like is
        what is known as the separation of concerns. Similar to encapsulation, a program should always strive to divide
        up work based on certain tasks.
    </p>
    <!-- PUT PICTURE OF FILE STRUCTURE HERE -->
    <p>
        This level of organization may seem tedious or overemphasized. The importance, however, of a well-organized and
        well-written program cannot be overstated. To give a more realistic example, I'll refer to the calculator's file
        structure that has been mentioned in previous articles. While not shown in the previous examples, pictured
        above is the file-structure of the calculator's code. Here, you can see a general calculator file, with 2 files
        within alongside a calculator.py file and an __init__.py file. Already, a general organization structure can
        be seen from the files. The calculator.py file is the main file where all the work comes together. Further, a
        calculations folder and a history folder can be found inside, where the calculations' folder is in charge of the
        math aspect of the calculator and the history folder is in charge of the lesser functionality of the calculator.
        This separation of concern is beneficial especially for reusing code. Say you are writing another program with
        calculator functionality. Instead of having to parse through disorganized files and refactor code, you would be
        able to copy and paste the existing folders into your new projects, and with small tweaks to your code, you would
        be able to copy and paste your calculator in a completely different project.
