    <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
    <h3 class="lead">Amazon and Ebay</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Amazon was founded in the garage of Jeff Bezos Seattle home in the summer of 1995. As the web became popular, Bezos started to brainstorm things that could be sold online. Books always ended up at the top of his list. Bezos' idea behind selling books was that there is millions of book titles in print around the world. There is no way a physical bookstore can hold millions of titles. Things can be built online that cannot exist in any other way. Jeff was extremely analytical and all about the business plan. Amazon went public in 1997, when the company was just 2 years old and had no profit.</li>
        <li>Ebay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in Silicon Valley in 1995. Pierre Omidyar was just a humble programmer that thought it would be cool to have an online marketplace. Unlike Amazon, there was no real business plan. Ebay needed a serious business professional at the helm to be taken serious on wall street. So Ebay hired Meg Whitman as the CEO and went public in 1998. The company's stocks soared on the first day. So much so that the company was valued at 2 billion after. </li>
        <li> Both Amazon and Ebay experienced early success. In Amazon's first 30 days, they shipped books to 45 different countries. Amazon had to get rid of their original business plan because of how fast the company was growing. The original plan was made for gradual growth. Ebay was also earning thousands in fees within the first few months it was launched.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="lead">The Bubble</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The dot com bubble started in 1995 with the IPO of NetScape. The Yahoo!, Excite, Amazon, and Ebay went public. Henry Blodget predicted that Amazon's shares would double in a year and that the stock would be somewhere in the $300 to $500 range. Blodget's prediction cause the shares to double in just a few weeks. Investors could not get to stockbrokers fast enough to snatch any stock with a dot com attached to it. This led to startups spending senselessly. More than a dozen dot com startups spent 2.2 million on 30 second spots during the Super Bowl TV ad campaign. On April 14, 2000, the Internet Commerce bubble burst. Nasdaq fell 355 points in a week that the index fell 25%. This was the biggest collapse in the history of the stock market. </li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="lead">Technologies That Drove The Growth Of The Internet</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The internet was growing at an unbelievable pace. To put this into perspective, The radio took 38 years to reach 50 million users,the television took 13 years to reach 50 million users, and the internet took just 4 years to reach 50 million users.</li>
        <li>Silicon Chip</li>
        <li>Moore's Law - states the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessors to memory chips doubles every 18 months. The Point of this law was that you can get tremendous growth without many steps</li>
        <li>Metcalfe’s Law - every new node that's added to the network doesn't just increase the network's value by plus 1, the curve is much steeper than that. For Example,  10 users = 45 possible connections.</li>
    </ul>
