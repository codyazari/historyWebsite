    <h1>Internet Search</h1>
    <h3 class="lead">The Beginning of Search Engines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1994, Jerry Yang and David Filo were looking for an advantage in a Stanford Fantasy Basketball. Little did they know, this gave them the idea to develop the search engine we all know today as Yahoo! At the time, no one had found a way to make money on the internet. Yahoo! showed it was possible to make money on the internet by taking banner ads.</li>
        <li> In 1996, Yahoo! had a bunch of challengers. The biggest challenger was Excite. This was because  Excite designed an algorithm to crawl the web rather than of Yahoo’s primitive handmade queries. </li>
        <li>Search Engines lost track of what made them popular in the first place. The search part. At this point, no search engine was all that great.</li>
        <li>Stanford students, Larry Paige and Sergey Brin created Google. Google was developed around the concept of link counting. This was the first search engine that was actually good at searching the web. Google's traffic brought Stanford University internet to its knees. They were forced to move off campus.  </li>
        <li>Google reached out to every search engine about an alliance and they were shut down everytime. They finally reached out to an old Professor, David Cheritan. Cheritan happened to be working with Silicon investor, Andy Bechtolsheim. Andy met with Larry and Sergey to talk about the Google idea and he called it “The best Idea he has heard in his entire life.” That very same day, Andy wrote them a check for 100,000 dollars. Google ended up getting multiple checks totaling in 1 Million. This is not much in Silicon Valley for what they were trying to do.</li>
        <li> Larry and Sergey then met with John Doerr, Venture Capitalist. Doerr asked Larry and Sergey how big they think Google would be. They replied "10 Billion in revenue." Doerr wrote a check for 12 Million dollars and was matched by Mike Moritz, Venture Capitalist.</li>
        <li>Both Larry Paige and Sergey Brin were nervous after receiving these generous investments. The pressure began to mount and Google was running out of time to figure out a way to make money. They then copied Bill Gross, the founder of the Idea Lab, who had cracked the code of online advertising. They adopted the idea of paying for search placement. Just like Yellow Pages. Internet Economy was born and Google was the key player.</li>
        <li> Google went public in 2004. By 2007, Google was valued higher than McDonalds, Walmart, Intel, Fedex, Coke, and IBM.</li>
